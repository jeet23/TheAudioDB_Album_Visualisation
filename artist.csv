2109614,A Rush of Blood to the Head,Coldplay,2002,Rock/Pop,Pop-Rock,Parlophone,Album,15000000,2,8.4,7,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, Coldplay's new album A Rush Of Blood To The Head is a consolidated evolution from their comparatively naÃ¯ve debut, Parachutes. The die-hard Coldplay fans looking for another Parachutes and the bloodthirsty critics who demand to see some progression will all walk away happy.
A Rush of Blood to the Head is inimitably Coldplay; Chris Martin's familiar vocals, the band's signature harmonies, strings and piano are all there but disarmingly there is a lot more to this album. It's undoubtedly the album we all expected but it's also smarter; more poetic, more mature.
""Politik"", the album's opener makes for a driving, imposing start with Martin's distinctive vocals reverberating eerily above urgent piano chords. It's unusually dramatic for a band once dubbed by ex-Creation mogul Alan McGee as ""Bedwetters"". The second track, the first written post-Parachutes and sounding like a refugee from that album, is the grower ""In My Place"". It's a fantastic pop tune that justifies Coldplay's status as one of UK's most exciting bands.
The haunting, surprisingly cynical theme that originates in ""Politik"" is continued in ""God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"" which sees the band at full stretch, lyrically as well as musically. You can sense them pushing themselves to prove to the world that there is a lot more to Coldplay than chart friendly singles.
Then, mid-album, they let all their hard work go to waste with the insipid, vanilla tracks ""The Scientist"" and ""Clocks"". They pass you by and fail to raise even the smallest emotion. Daylight"" and ""A Whisper"" find the band back at their best with epic, yet simple melancholic tunes. Here repetitive choruses and hypnotic, violin sounding guitars take the listener on an exciting journey that you wish wouldn't end.
Coldplay are a band very much in touch with their emotions, which frequently works in their favour. Martin's heartfelt, passionate vocals on the piano driven ""Warning Sign"" transform a song which in other hands could descend to the pathetic: ""Come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in...The truth is I miss you""
Despite a couple of weak moments this is asuperb album that might just capture your heart and your imagination. Don't struggle; enjoy a rush of blood to the head.",Relaxed,Medium

2109616,Mylo Xyloto,Coldplay,2011,Rock/Pop,Pop-Rock,Parlophone,Album,8000000,1,7.8,8,"Don’t Coldplay love their Xs and their Ys? And their enigmatic album titles? After 2005’s X&Y and 2008’s Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends comes Mylo Xyloto. Well, it beats Coldplay 5. But any title that needs a pronunciation guide (it’s ""My-lo zy-letoe"") sounds like it’s trying a bit too hard. Maybe Chris Martin still yearns for something that infers the depth and gravitas of a Bono or Thom Yorke. The album is apparently a concept work, ""based on a love story with a happy ending,"" Martin claims, and inspired by old-school American graffiti and the anti-Nazi pacifist White Rose Movement: ""It's about being free to be yourself and to express yourself among negative surroundings."" But the lyrics are still typically Martin’s life-affirming, anthem-forming and plain-speaking as ever, more ABC than MYLO XYLOTO.
The same goes for the music. Bassist Guy Berryman said in 2009, ""It's time to take our music down different directions and really explore other avenues,"" and, in name alone, this set suggests Coldplay might finally do an Achtung Baby; they might rip it up and start again, in the presence of said U2 LP’s producer Brian Eno, who also worked on Viva la Vida. If the addition of electronic undertows, instrumental snippets (the title-track, M.M.I.X., A Hopeful Transmission) linking many of the tracks and the presence of Rihanna on Princess of China count as ""other avenues"", then job well done. But Mylo Xyloto is much more a brilliant, shiny and emphatic reinstatement of the euphoric hooks and cuddly ballads that have served the band so well. Case in point: Paradise, where melting strings and church organ feed into a brilliant chorus line that equal parts Fix You and Viva la Vida’s title-track. But the main vocal chorus doesn’t arrive until over two minutes in, building the tension; the pay-off is both simple and devastating. It’s the equal of Yellow, and when Coldplay return to Glastonbury it will take the roof off the sky.
Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall goes one step further than Paradise by lifting Vida la Vida’s ""who-hoa!"" hook, suggesting Coldplay can’t truly comprehend new avenues. U2-shaped echoes still run through the deep and wide canyons of their landscaped sound ”“ Major Minus features The Edge-patented guitar chatter, but it’s nevertheless a triumph. Charlie Brown has one of those Coldplay-patented sun-breaking-through-clouds moments; Us Against the World (the sentiment that unites the graffiti and anti-Nazi camps) is the key wistful/cuddly ballad alongside Up in Flames, a successful grafting of soul onto the Coldplay model, helped by an understated falsetto and the simplest of piano parts (echoes of Parachutes’ gorgeous Everything’s Not Lost).
The closing Up With the Birds, which samples Leonard Cohen, is a serene finale that shows Coldplay understand the change of dynamics more than the dynamics of change. Better this than the nominally Euro-disco bent of Princess of China, where Rihanna’s presence feels more of a marketing tool than a creative necessity, and there’s yet another ""who-ay-oh-oh!"" chant just in case Coldplay were straying too far from their remit. This appears to support Martin’s message of expressing the freedom to be yourself under negative surroundings ”“ not to change just because critics of the band tell them they should. Mylo Xyloto may have an oblique title but it’s a triumph because the music is anything but.",Relaxed,Medium
2109617,Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends,Coldplay,2008,Rock/Pop,Pop-Rock,Atlantic,Album,10000000,,7.2,5,"Paradoxically everything that fuels cynicism about the stadium-proof nature of Coldplay is also what makes them undeniably great. Yes, if you find huge choruses that contain wordless exhortations, ponderous one note bass lines and vaporous lyrics that convey nameless heartache to be the very tools of Satan, then Viva La Vida has much to wind you up. If, however, you're one of their millions of fans then it's an unqualified triumph. The rest of us (and EMI, for whom, allegedly, their very future depends on this selling by the shedload) can also rest easy. For, by bringing Brian Eno onboard as sonic nurse, Coldplay have managed to effortlessly make a record that's accomplished and yet pulls off the same trick that U2 managed when they employed the bald one - massaging their sound into something different enough to keep the formula (and make no mistake it IS a formula) fresh.
Two years in gestation, with a break in the middle to do a bit of cultural tourism (and touring) in South America, Viva La Vida wrong foots you by starting with Life In Technicolour; an instrumental that reeks of Eno's ambience while also utilising something that sounds suspiciously like a zither. The world music tropes are limited however. Cemeteries Of London may have an off-kilter rhythmic undertow and Lost! seems to sport bongos in its mix, yet it's the plaintive voice with its vague sense of regret, the lifts from minor key piano forays into vast, pumping rock and also a strident optimism that people are going to come here for. The band deliver all this in spades: 42 and Death And All His Friends most notably.
Elsewhere it's that patent (and potent) mix of upbeat and fatalistic that reminds you why the band hit the bullseye every time. Only on Strawberry Swing does Chris' chirpiness start to grate. 

It all sounds so easy, yet when you imagine the pressure on all concerned to deliver the goods, it's little short of miraculous. Again, cynics may argue that it's Eno's fourth world fairy dust that sugar coats songs that really don't live up to Martin's promise of a very different sound. The string/brass mutations that bolster a track like Viva La Vida may not be a million miles from his mates, The Arcade Fire, but I bet they'd donate several limbs to conjure tunes so sweetly melancholy. Any way you look at it, this is a massive album. Get used to it, you'll be hearing it a LOT over the next two years.",Relaxed,Medium
2109618,X&Y,Coldplay,2005,Rock/Pop,Pop-Rock,Parlophone,Album,12000000,3,8.4,8,"You've heard the single, read the reviews and listened to the interviews; everything suggests Coldplay's new album is going to be great. But it's not until you hear the first few bars of the opening track that you know that the band are going to achieve everything they hoped and dreamed of.
This album is superb. It'll silence their critics, amaze their fans and win them a whole new legion of admirers. It might even bring about world peace! I'm sure that was one of Chris Martin's objectives for this album...
""Square One"" opens the record in typically anthemic fashion: 'Is there anywhere you want to go? The future's for discovering'. Martin has the knack of writing lyrics that affect individuals on a massive scale. Thousands have fallen for his simple songs about hope, loss, love and happiness. X&Y is full of touching eulogiessuch as ""A Message"" and ""Swallowed In The Sea"" which express complete and honest love for a partner.
Much has been made of Coldplay challenging U2's title of biggest band in the world. Martin may spend a great deal of time emulating Bono by talking to politicians and canvassing support for his causes but, unlike Bono, these issues haven't crept into his songwriting. There are no protest songs here.
On this record Martin proves once again that he's an excellent singer while Buckland has become, according to Chris, a 'guitar hero'. Add bass player Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion and you have four great musicians. Their powers peak on ""Talk"", a fantastic song that is, on an album of big songs, positively gargantuan. More evidence that Coldplay are far and away the best at what they do. Imitators such as Thirteen Senses, Keane and Longview can't touch them.
Other album highlights include ""Low"", perhaps the most frantic song they've recorded, which features some awesome guitar licks. And the secret final track, ""'Til Kingdom Come"", where the threadbare acoustic guitar contrasts wonderfully with the big album sound.
Martin has repeatedly spoken of howhe loves every minute of being in Coldplay. His passion is genuine; he's living his dream, making music he loves and playing live to thousands of adoring fans every night. And Martin is doing all this with his three best mates. Coldplay are a closely knit group of musicians, a band of men with one aim -to make the best music in the world. On the epic X&Y they're on the brink of achieving that goal.",Relaxed,Medium

2282194,Kaleidoscope EP,Coldplay,2017,Rock/Pop,Alternative Rock,Parlophone,EP,0,,9,1,"The EP is a glorious return to Coldplay’s mid-’00s explorative period. Opening track ‘All I Can Think About Is You’ begins as a dusky, ambient Radiohead art-throb in which a muffled Martin mumbles about “chaos giving orders”, sounding as if he’s hiding underwater from the political nightmares of 2017. Then, three minutes in, familiar ‘Clocks’ piano chords kick in and the tune becomes a celestial scream of adoration, love rising above Trumpageddon.  Aliens, a collaboration with Brian Eno, is even more outré, mingling Spanish guitar with space-age synths. These five tracks climax with ‘Hypnotised’, a solemn country swooner resembling John Lennon’s ‘Mother’, easily their best barnstorming ballad since ‘Fix You’. It’s heartening evidence that Coldplay haven’t entirely been sucked into the machinery while trying to subvert pop music from within. Is it too much to hope that their Avicii period was the experiment, and this the return to the norm?   -- Reviewed by  nme.com

2113725,+,Ed Sheeran,2011,Rock/Pop,Pop,Atlantic,Album,3925000,2,8.3,3,"Lines between genres have never been more blurred than right now, especially in the mainstream. Experimentation with styles and the melding of musical approaches is to be commended, obviously; but to relate authenticity with consistent, similar output is something very wrong indeed, as not everybody singing the same song is coming from the same place. These charting mutations and variations have as much to do with our culture of instant gratification as they do with music growing out-of-date more quickly ”“ and what better person to stand tall at the lectern than 20-year-old Ed Sheeran, whose unlikely combination of acoustic folk and grime has seen him become one of 2011’s biggest domestic successes.
This is a man who’s been couch-surfing for six years while incessantly gigging, putting out new music, plugging, and building a fanbase (and getting said fans to absolutely worship him). He’s worked with grime artists and toured with Nizlopi, getting shout-outs along the way from Elton John and Jamie Foxx. Given the effort he’s put in, it’s certainly hard to begrudge Sheeran his achievements to date. Raised in Framlingham, Suffolk, he could always see further than the confines of his home town, and recorded his first EP aged 14 ”“ the same year MySpace was bought for $580m by NewsCorp, for some context. Hard grafters were slightly easier to spot in 2005, and users of social media had to try harder to define themselves: The JCB Song’s run for the Christmas number one felt like a huge-scale rebellion back then.
But it’s a shame that Sheeran’s biography is a better summation of where we’re at right now than this debut album, on which his precocious self-referencing can become infuriating. You Need Me, I Don’t Need You is unbearable, as he sings, ""I’ve done around about a thousand shows / But I haven’t got a house plus I live on a couch / So you believe the lyrics when I’m singing them out"". The escapist Drunk is sweet, but his auto-biographical approach to writing has a very limited shelf-life because, essentially, the story just isn’t interesting enough to stretch across 12 tracks. There are standout cuts, though: Grade 8 is a flying track made for radio which opens with a bassline seeped in the nostalgia of Wifey by RnB boyband Next. The City’s chorus also soars; again, the song draws on 90s RnB with Sheeran’s driving, natural delivery and some emphatic drum fills comprising winning constituents.
+ will give Sheeran’s rabid fanbase a lot to love, but it’ll also make him an easy target for critics hungry for new directions in pop, as it fails to really gel the man’s loves of folk and rap. But even though originality isn’t quite what it could be throughout this set, the way he observes and picks situations apart is quite something ”“ something to be developed for album two, certainly. If he ditches his bottom-of-a-Tube-escalator ballads (see Kiss Me) and stops trying to show off, Sheeran could well become a thrilling proposition over an entire long-player, rather than just in all-too-brief moments of magic.",Philosophical,Medium

2132504,Speak Now,Taylor Swift,2010,Rock/Pop,Country,,Album,4200000,,6,1,"They grow up so fast these days, don’t they? Having taken the lion’s share of the writing credits on 2008’s mammoth-selling Fearless, all of the songs on Taylor Swift’s new album are self-penned, betraying the sort of accomplishment that should keep her sitting pretty in the rock firmament for as long as she likes. Still only 20, that could be a mighty long time.

Although Nathan Chapman is still in the producer’s chair, there’s a perceptible, sonic move away from Nashville; the shift had clearly begun on Fearless, managing the crossover to the global mainstream with ease, but Speak Now plugs a sturdy marker in the pop-rock soil. On current single and terrific opening track Mine, the slide guitar is buried so deep in mix, it’s almost apologetic – or even a joke at the expense of Swift’s roots. But the twang in her voice is here to stay, somehow reinforcing the emotional heft of her homespun tales of teen love and loss.

Those preoccupations remain to the fore, yet a creeping maturity is plain. On serene ballad Dear John, Swift wonders, ""Don’t you think 19’s too young to be played by your dark, twisted games?"", and later, on the spidery Innocent, she sighs, ""It’s okay, life is a tough crowd"". This is a more bruised writer than the young Juliet on Love Story. Last Kiss is heartbreaking (""You told me you loved me so why did you go… away?""), a lump in the throat to a music box waltz. Nestled amid all the love and regret, however, are sunburst pop nuggets like Never Grow Up and Enchanted that would brighten any daytime radio playlist. And on closer Long Live, personal reflections take on a more triumphant tone, a late shot of versatility that underlines Swift’s narrative skill.

Talent to burn has its own pitfalls, of course. At 14 songs – and most comfortably over four minutes – Speak Now is too long, and when you’ve heard half a dozen perky laments you’ve heard, well, quite a lot. Swift is less convincing too when practising a snarly edge on Better Than Revenge or letting rip with her overwrought inner Bonnie Tyler on Haunted, but these only jar because quality elsewhere is so high. With some judicious – let’s have it then – tailoring, this is a sparky and affecting record, moving Swift on at a stately and assured pace.",Needy,

But she saves up her ballad mojo for the killer finale ""New Year's Day,"" which continues her streak of ending each album with a sinus-exploding mess of a tearjerker. It's the quietest moment on Reputation, yet the most powerful – she wakes up after a glam New Year's bash (""Glitter on the floor after the party/Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby"") and reflects on what she has left to call her own, which is the not-so-glam partner she'll be spending this not-so-glam day with.

2113853,My Worlds,Justin Bieber,2010,Rock/Pop,Pop,,Album,0,,7,1,"Justin Bieber is a young man with a sweet voice who has been transformed into a huge entertainment machine. His CD insert lists everyone involved in his career so far, from the studio engineers and executive producers to the legal team and even the lady responsible for “grooming” that perfect hair. There’s no room for lyrics and barely any for photos.

My Worlds is Justin’s debut mini-album My World expanded, incorporating the tracks released as My World 2.0 in the US. It has been released in two halves because of an early, insatiable demand for songs, once his YouTube appeal was translated into a record deal.

Now, for all the talk about this album being by a teenager, for teenagers, there’s not a lot going on here which is unique to modern youth. Most people know what a first dance is, for example. And even the fustiest of grown-ups can work out what an “eenie meenie minie moe lover” is, if they think about it hard enough.

In fact it’s the songs which try to show understanding of the teenage world which fall over easily. Somebody to Love is a straightforward plea for a soul mate; it says something we’ve all felt, whereas I can safely say that no-one has ever compared love to maths homework, as they do in Common Denominator.

But despite the clunky moments, there’s ample proof that Team Bieber know exactly what they’re doing and who they’re talking to. As you’d expect, it’s the ballads that hit the hardest.

Stuck in the Moment is the classic doomed-love tragedy: they can’t be together, but they cannot bear to part. Naturally it mentions Romeo and Juliet, and Bonnie and Clyde. Up is the flipside, in which Justin realises love makes him invulnerable.

That Should Be Me, the grand finale, is going to cause nothing but emotional pandemonium in households and bedrooms all over the land. It’s a sobbing ballad in which Justin pleads the girl who left him behind (how could she?) to take him back.

To which his fans will answer as one: Justin, we would never have let you go in the first place.",Good Natured,Medium

2113855,Believe,Justin Bieber,2012,Rock/Pop,Pop,,Album,500000,,6,2,"Marking his progression from screaming-kids-in-tow starlet to something close to a pop god, Justin Bieber’s new album not only finds him becoming an artist for adults on his own terms, but showcasing impressively distinctive tones and translating an innate charisma across many styles.

Believe is glitzier than his debut, My World(s), but Bieber doesn’t leave his faithful audience behind in pursuit of a broader fanbase. There are still returns to his years of tween appeal, notably on Be Alright, Fall and the title track.

But throughout, this album presents proof that expensive-sounding songs don’t need to be about material things, regardless of how much Bieber wants to scream that he’s an adult now. Despite the array of impressive guest contributors – Nicki Minaj, Drake, Ludacris, Big Sean, Mike Posner, Diplo – Bieber’s never overshadowed. He has grown into this role to such an extent that the ""featuring"" turns never steal his spotlight.

He’s aware that he’s still three years too young to get into the clubs where his beats belong; lyrically, his focus on love and faith is both explicit and suitably open – and, admirably, never puerile. Stepping back briefly, he’s simply being the teen star that he still is. The unshowiness of Bieber’s lyrics is played up, and his confidence, for the most part, played down.

It’s fine that his vocal simpers on the verses of As Long As You Love Me, because the song’s pulsating undercurrent propels it onto the dancefloor. And this is exactly why comparisons with Justin Timberlake’s showy dreamboat persona are misleading. Believe presents Bieber as an 18-year-old in love, rather than desperate for an audience to adore him.

The way he gets introspective on the Babyface-produced Catching Feelings is a rare delight: it sees him caught up in a daydream, like Robin Thicke for a younger generation. And other highlights are plentiful: Die in Your Arms’ Michael Jackson sample is worth every penny, while One Love’s space-age synths, watered down DnB beat and defiant lack of fluff make it a total mega-hit.

Believe doesn’t take as many risks as it might (those are saved for bonus tracks), but it’s not meant to be a big and bold collection. It’s simply, elegantly, propelling Bieber into the next chapter of his career. And for an album whose aims are so remarkably graceful, Believe exceeds all expectations.",Good Natured,Medium
2134186,My World,Justin Bieber,2009,Rock/Pop,Pop,,EP,0,,8,1,"Justin Bieber is guaranteed to bring out the worst in critics looking to write the cocky teenager (have you seen him being interviewed? He certainly doesn’t lack confidence) off without a single listen to this, ‘part one’ of his debut album. He’s got the fame (initially via YouTube), if not the fortune yet, and he’s just 15. Makes you sick. But such is the talent assembled here that nobody should assume the Canadian’s a gimmicky artist with a short shelf life, pitched to appeal exclusively to Disney Channel viewers.

This disc – part two will follow later this year, explaining just the seven tracks on offer here – finds the piercingly high-pitched vocalist working with such big industry names as Usher (who effectively got him his deal), The-Dream, Zeke Lewis and Tricky Stewart. That’s some support, and for the most part it serves its purpose well: the studious graft behind Bieber’s completely generic, RnB-inflected, Auto-Tune’d pop vocals comprises the bulk of this record’s appeal. Unspectacular but never below-par, these arrangements efficiently evince the star of the show’s ability, which while limited is sure to develop. After all, from the sounds of things he’s yet to hit puberty.

Which does make for several awkward lyrical moments: “I was a player when I was younger,” Bieber states on Bigger, leaving one to hope he’s talking about Little League rather than chasing skirt. Hit single One Time is similarly uncomfortable, our protagonist’s insistence that “many have called” but he’s choosing this one girl (lucky her, though she’ll have to stoop for a kiss) sure to make most with Real Life Relationship Experience cringe. But its thudding beat and syrupy message of monogamic commitment are perfect ingredients for mainstream appeal. Plus, its PG-rated content ensures no parent is going to frown upon their offspring indulging in a little idolising.

Perfunctory fare, then, but nothing to get unnecessarily aggrieved about, My World is introduction enough to both embrace a sizeable audience – okay, fundamentally those of a similar age to the artist – and accept the rejection of just as many squirming listeners. It’s production-line stuff, but with just the slightest sting in its tail:  an electro-infused reinterpretation of The Cardigans' Lovefool, where Bieber exhibits the right kind of attitude, playful and endearing. Here’s to less of the adolescent playboy on part two, and more of the cheeky chap rightfully having the time of his young life.",Good Natured,Medium

2110664,Encore,Eminem,2004,Urban/R&B,Hip-Hop,,Album,11000000,,6.8,5,"Encore finds Marshall Mathers at something of a crossroads in his career. 31-years-old, rich and successful -he's played the belligerent poor white trash outsider for five years now. Kicking back in his big executive Shady Records chair, you've got to wonder if he's still got the stomach to become Eminem.
Having cleared out the closet of his private life, what does the man whos given us five years of rants against his mother and his ex-wife (not to mention 8 Mile) have left to say about his favorite subject: himself?
The result, ultimately, is not a lot. Encore starts fantastically but ends abominably. Actually, it's worse than that.Twothirdsof this record could be Weird Al Yankovic, such is its woefulness.
This is particularly frustrating when opener ""Evil Deeds"" suggests it could have been his In Utero - ""The shows over, you can all go home now"", he spits wearily, ""but the curtain don't close for me"".
Sidestepping the soap opera of his personal life, this is Eminem at his most thrilling -holding his outsider status up to the light while untangling the bullshit world of corporate hip-hop. ""Like Toy Soldiers"" is a cutting indictment on the machismo world of the beef (against a giddily addictive Martika sample) and ""Mosh"" directs some well-aimed anger at the current US administration.
But, from that moment on, he bottles it. To the sound of retching and a flushing toilet we're straight into ""Puke"". It's an appropriate metaphor for an album that degenerates into nothing more than an extended fart joke.
The lowpoints? There's too many to mention - although the desperate misogyny of ""Spend Some Time"" should probably be singled out. That's saying something on a track listing that includes ""Big Weenie"" and ""Ass Like That""; this is bottom feeder stuff.
The woeful D-12 appear , Anthill Mob-like, at the end to pop a few caps, but by then it's too late. Encore is an album for the downloaders -afew great songs tacked onto an hour of dicking about.",Angry,Medium

The rapper's painkiller addiction and reclusive behaviour which followed best friend Proof's murder threatened to end Marshall Mathers' career for good. Given this bleak period and Em's penchant for violent imagery and misanthropic themes, fans may imagine Relapse to be a tough listening experience.
On first song 3AM Dr Dre's slasher-movie score synths mirror Em's tale of murder and amnesia. Lyrically, it's brutally evocative with a Silence Of the Lambs reference and lines like, ''Wake up naked at McDonald's covered in blood again'' and, ''Put the key in my door/bodies laying all over the floor''.
On My Mom the MC who first complained about said parent on 1999 hit My Name Is correctly states ''I know you're tired about hearing about my Mom''. But he continues, ''What kind of Mom wants her son to grow up as an underf******achiever?'' If that profanity seems shoehorned in there's no shortage of it throughout Relapse. It's an angry work.
Insane suggests Mom may have turned a blind eye to abuse from a step-father with the pitch-black couplet: ''One night he walked in and said ''I want my **** sucked in the shed/ can't I play Teddy Ruxpin instead?''.
Medicine Ball sees Slim Shady mimic paralysed Superman actor Christopher Reeves to say ''Let's breakdance'' amid the sleekest production on the record.
Incongruous single We Made You is the album's only real commercial moment and a hilarious dissection of fame, all Bugsy Malone piano loops, references to Amy Winehouse's marital troubles and sung chorus.
Two rare frivolous tracks, Old Times' Sake and Must Be The Ganja, are serviceable smoking anthems, with the former seeing Dr Dre rap ''If at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed''.
This sixth album from Detroit's superstar is typically uncompromising and full of characteristically spiky humour. Relapse is as honest, funny, assured and well-produced as anyone would expect from Eminem and Dr Dre. The only real fault is evident when comparisons are made. It's a great album but on a musical and emotional level Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak is undeniably fresher.",Angry,

That's where Linkin Park come in. The shout ""Stay away from me!"" on the first track on their new album. You know exactly how they feel. They are angry and insecure and clever and great.
Hybrid Theory was the best rock album of the past three years. It was also the best selling album in the world in 2001. A tightly controlled montage of hooks, riffs, dodgy rapping, roaring, sweet singing, noises and scratching, ruthlessly edited into classic songs. Sixteen year olds going through hormone hell loved it. So did their dads.
It's therefore no surprise that Meteora doesn't live up to its predecessor. The riffs, hooks and shouting are all present and correct. But the first four songs all sound the same and the guitars don't cut through as they should.
But then ""Easier To Run"" comes along. It's gorgeous: a wonderful sad power ballad, and will surely becomea huge hit single. After that every track gets better. ""Faint"", built around a driving string sample, is the first song to really break sweat and get your head shaking. ""Breaking The Habit"" is a paranoid version of Don Henley's ""The Boys Of Summer"": a very good thing. ""Nobody's Listening"" is strong, confident rap metal. ""Numb"" is bitter-sweet and beautiful and ends the album on a high. The best of these songs are powerful, emotional, disciplined and impressive.
I'm not supposed to like this album. I'm 43 not 16. But although it's patchy, there are still moments which move me to tears.
There are two possible explanations. Either I'm emotionally retarded. Or Linkin Park make great music.",Angry,Medium
2111328,A Thousand Suns,Linkin Park,2010,Rock/Pop,Metal,,Album,840000,,6.8,4,"It shouldn’t really be a surprise, but it’s still a shock to the system, exploding expectations like broken billiard balls. Minutes to Midnight, Linkin Park’s third album, made clear the California sextet’s move from nu-metal dynamics to something softer and more mainstream-friendly (not that they were struggling to shift records ”“ 2000 debut Hybrid Theory has sold over 24 million copies). But if that was the sound of a band embracing their classic rock side, A Thousand Suns is, at its zenith/nadir (delete according to taste), Celine Dion Goes Mall Rock.
This album’s closer, The Messenger, is the wettest song to ever fill the raspy throat of flaming-armed frontman Chester Bennington. It’s on a level with Avril Lavigne’s I’m With You, or Christina Aguilera’s Beautiful, only hollered hoarsely rather than pitched painfully high. Similarly wet about their edges are Iridescent ”“ an exercise in Gallaghers-level rhyming ”“ and Burning in the Skies.
However, it should be noted that Linkin Park were not intending to make an album when they set about recording these less-than-impressive efforts. They were playing with ideas, breaking down concepts that’d served them well previously, trying to find something fresh. They didn’t want whatever their next album was to be predictable, and while A Thousand Suns might have emerged by accident compared to previous LPs, it’s certainly a far from plays-to-perceived-type affair.
The aforementioned blips on this critic’s radar can’t obscure some perplexingly compelling material elsewhere. When They Come for Me lays its intent on the line with its first words: ""I am not a pattern to be followed"". The track’s jungle percussion and backing chants give it a tribal feel, and if the lead vocals ”“ rapped, badly ”“ were just a touch peppier there’s no doubt it’d be a magic moment of their catalogue to date. Blackout is a lot of fun, Bennington ranting potty-mouthed across an electro-tinged arrangement that isn’t so many stylistic miles away from the crunchy beats served up by Pendulum, albeit slowed and scratched into a dizzy spin. The Catalyst is the closest A Thousand Suns comes to the Linkin Park sound of old, and is among this collection’s most immediate offerings. It’s no surprise it’s been well received at radio, plucked from its parent LP as the first commercial single.
But the penultimate track here really shouldn’t be a sign of things to come, simply an echo of the past. If Linkin Park take the best moments of this haphazard set as jumping-off points for what happens next, they might just strike upon a new formula every bit as successful as the one that flogged their debut so brilliantly.",Angry,Medium
2111329,Minutes to Midnight,Linkin Park,2007,Rock/Pop,Metal,,Album,8000000,1,6.8,6,"I’m a big fan of Linkin Park’s mix of pop, rap and metal. But they are struggling to live up to the brilliance of their first album, the multi million selling Hybrid Theory. Minutes To Midnight their third album, took 14 months to write and record: an ominous sign. If the sleeve photo is any indication, half the band have grown beards while working on it.
The opening song “Given Up” is great: twisted, moshing, rousing punk with lots of f-words. But the rest of the album features too many bitter-sweet mood pieces like “Leave Out All The Rest” and “Shadow Of The Day”. These are impeccably crafted, but lack killer choruses, and stay rooted to the ground despite all their efforts to take wing. The current single “What I’ve Done” feels like a thin rewrite of “Numb”, the sound of a band alarmingly trapped in its’ own formula.
The best tracks come when Linkin Park take risks. “Bleed It Out” is exciting quick fire rap with lots of handclaps. And when they move beyond adolescent finger pointing and start to get really angry the results are really successful. “Hands Held High” is a moving anti-Iraq war rap set to an ironic backdrop of church organ and military snare drum. The churning rock riffs of “No More Sorrows” may not be particularly original but it attacks warmongers in a thoroughly entertaining and exciting way. The album closer “Little Things Give You Way” adds a bitter, clever lyric inspired by a visit to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, to a soaring and successful piece of stadium rock.
This is a patchy album. Linkin Park need to get some fire in their bellies if they are to keep up to their own high standards.",Angry,Medium
2111330,Living Things,Linkin Park,2012,Rock/Pop,Metal,,Album,0,1,6.7,6,"In 2010, without anyone really noticing, Linkin Park released one of the most innovative and astounding albums of the year. A Thousand Suns was not so much a collection of songs as a tapestry of sound that sometimes veered, sometimes glided, between the confrontational agit-pop of Public Enemy and sombre, expectations-eschewing acoustic selections.
On its sleeve notes, the group bent over backwards to explain that this was no ordinary body of work; and in doing so suggested that this was a band with no faith in the intelligence of those who paid money into their bank accounts. But even allowing for this slightly patronising stance, A Thousand Suns was a body of work startling enough that it gambled with the massive commercial success the group had achieved since their debut album, 2000’s Hybrid Theory.
Living Things is not an album of the same calibre as the one it succeeds. Whereas the promise of that album suggested that Linkin Park may have been on the way to becoming mainstream radio’s Radiohead, the feel of this follow-up gives the impression that quintet have pulled back from this brink.
While it’s impossible for an outside party to guess at a band’s motivation when recording new songs, to these ears Linkin Park are not trying as hard as they once did. That’s not to say that Living Things is a lazy album ”“ in fact, far from it. Songs such as the pimp-rolling Lies Greed Misery and the electronic monster-balladry of Powerless are pieces that showcase this band’s approach that tracks are not so much composed as they are constructed.
With this architecture in place, overseen by bandleader Mike Shinoda, Linkin Park will always be a compelling and watchable entity. But Living Things doesn’t deliver music as interesting or as arresting as what immediately preceded it. Which comes as both a surprise and, more importantly, a shame.",Angry,
2111331,Hybrid Theory,Linkin Park,2000,Rock/Pop,Metal,Warner Bros. Records,Album,24000000,2,8.2,5,"Hybrid Theory received generally positive reviews from critics. Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters commented that the band was a ""far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late"", and claimed that ""they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds.""

Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory four out of five stars.

Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a ""two-star honorable mention rating"", citing ""Papercut"" and ""Points of Authority"" as highlights of the album.

Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone gave the album two and a half stars and commented that Hybrid Theory had ""as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn"" and called it an album that ""reflects the frustration of life"".

AllMusic writer William Ruhlmann said that ""Linkin Park sounds like a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style"" and called ""One Step Closer"" ""a typical effort"", referring to the lyrics of the song's chorus.

Johan Wippsson from Melodic praised Don Gilmore's production and described the albums as ""destructive and angry but always with a well controlled melodic feeling all over.""

NME's Noel Gardner commented that ""otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like 'With You' and 'A Place for My Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching,"" giving the album a score of six out of ten.

Tyler Fisher at Sputnikmusic gave the album a 3.0/5, saying ""Hybrid Theory stands as a defining mainstream album at the turn of the century, and for good reason."", but calling the guitar riffs ""often bland and unoriginal"".

Mike Ross of Jam! declares the albums as a combination of the best of hip hop and heavy metal. He goes on to state ""...they can actually rap. They can actually crank out a ferocious, head-banging groove. They can write introspective lyrics with intelligence. It adds up to one of the finest new rap metal bands I've ever heard.""

2126363,Unbreakable,Backstreet Boys,2007,Rock/Pop,Pop,,Album,0,,7,2,"If there is one word to describe the Backstreet Boys (BSB) it is defiant. After a three years absence, in 2005 the multi-million selling boy band decided it was time to mount a new assault. The band’s distinctly ‘rockier’ approach marked by the introduction of live instruments was met with a barrage of vitriolic press. But two years later, Backstreet Boys really are back (albeit one member lighter – Kevin Richardson left the band on amicable terms in 2006). Unperturbed by previous criticism, they have just released their sixth album, Unbreakable.
The rocky ballads are still here but this time there is a depth of feeling that makes some of the songs a little more credible. The first single ""Inconsolable"" features the trademark emotional wrangling but thankfully resists boy band cliches like the diabolical key change. ""Helpless When She Smiles"" produced by John Shanks (Bon Jovi) is a more visionary offering with an intriguing piano melody that provides at least some edge.
""Everything But Mine"" strays from typical BSB territory with its electro inspired offbeat riff – an interesting counter to the sharp falsetto vocals. ""Panic"" is another slightly more adventurous outing; beginning with a (tame) dubby drum & bass rhythm, it has moments of more daring musicality.
But despite a degree of experimentation there is little here to make a lasting impression. Laboured and repetitive ballads prevail. ""Love Will Keep You Up All Night’ is a montage of almost every love-song ever written and with a chorus reminiscent of Aerosmith’s ""Don’t Want To Miss A Thing’, sounds dated and overly earnest.
Some may doubt BSB’s relevance in the notoriously fickle contemporary pop climate – and they have good reason to, for while this is a valiant effort at reinvention and an at times gutsier record, Backstreet Boys have become a pastiche of themselves – until they turn their back on ballads, this is unlikely to change.",Party,

And, for a while, her attitude worked to superb effect: she's the quintessential ""more great songs than you initially assume"" artist, with Love Don't Cost a Thing, Whatever You Wanna Do, If You Had My Love and ”“ best of all ”“ the Murder remixes of Ain't It Funny and I'm Real all high-water marks. But even her most passionate defenders couldn't have expected her to be relevant in 2011, with her most recent material seeming to indicate a decline of interest on both the public's part and her own.
Yet this year has found Lopez reclaiming number one spots worldwide ”“ thanks in no small part to her latest iteration as all-caring, all-crying judge on American Idol. And so to the eventual emergence of Love?, an album that's undergone the tortuous gestation seemingly now de rigueur for any pop star beneath the BeyoncÃ© level. In that time, Lopez has clearly been taking copious notes on her rivals. From RedOne to The-Dream, she has hired across the spectrum of this era's pop producers du jour, and much of Love? finds her slipping discreetly into others' lanes: Good Hit mimics Ciara's kittenish sneer, Invading My Mind features the same combination of heavy, dubstep-influenced basslines and bubblegum-light melody as found on Britney Spears' latest album, and Hypnotico not only nods to Gagaist electro but is co-penned by the lady herself.
The same quality is both Lopez's strength and weakness. She possesses both a lightness of touch and the effortless confidence of one of nature's own divas, which means that whenever she hits the floor to essay up-tempo swagger tracks she convinces without being as overbearing as, say, Ke$ha. And of course the woman who gave us the supreme millennial house of Waiting for Tonight will know her way around On the Floor and Papi, both apparent distillations of the trashy Miami house aesthetic that dominates pop these days. But while Lopez has claimed that her new public image showcases the real her, she never could pull off the idea of being a real human being with actual emotions on record. Too much of Love? seeks to showcase her vulnerability and depth of feeling ”“ but while Lopez's insouciance can be affecting, the same isn't true when she tries her hand at the epic sweep of Until It Beats No More or One Love.",In Love,

Having said that, whoever decided that Jen should follow in Beyonce's massive funky footsteps with older-than-old-skool brass workouts like ""Get Right"" and ""Whatever You Wanna Do"" has earned their bling bonus for the financial year. And the sonic variety doesn't end there. ""I Got U"" is summery '70s soul, ""Cherry Pie"" is Prince meets NERD, and ""(Can't Believe) This Is Me"" could come straight out of a dramatic heartbreak moment in a Broadway musical (no, really!).
And ""Step Into My World"" deserves a special mention for being equal parts Timbaland log-drums, belly-dance poise and gasping harmonies that suit her voice down to the ground.

2120132,Dance Again... The Hits,Jennifer Lopez,2012,Rock/Pop,Pop,,Compilation,0,,9,1,"Like all good pop stars, Jennifer ""J.Lo"" Lopez has managed to ride the commercial zeitgeist with a certain amount of aplomb, drawing in whichever producer or rapper is hot at the time and bringing out something approaching their best work.
You want Irv Gotti-produced hip hop featuring Ja Rule? You've got it with I'm Real. You want horn-laced, Rich Harrison-produced RnB? There's some of that in the shape of Get Right. If your tastes are more dancefloor-based, ideally produced by RedOne and featuring Pitbull, then there's fare to suit your needs: namely Dance Again and On the Floor.
That a lot of her collaborators have fallen by the wayside is testament to J.Lo’s enduring appeal. Indeed, it's surprising that she hadn't unleashed a hits collection before now given that she's what you might politely call a ""singles artist"" ”“ none of her seven studio albums have reached the number one spot in the UK.
Yet there a couple of glaring omissions. For one, there's no room for the Christina Milian-penned Play, which slinked its way into the top three in 2001; and whoever decided to leave off the ridiculously toe-tappable RedOne-produced Papi needs to have a long, hard look in the mirror. But it's hard to argue with most of what's on offer, Lopez slipping effortlessly into different guises with each song.
On the brilliantly disingenuous Jenny from the Block she half-raps about being “real” at a time when she was dating Hollywood superstar Ben Affleck, while Love Don't Cost a Thing’s empowerment message chimed perfectly with the Independent Woman mantra of Destiny's Child. There's a versatility to her voice that means she can employ cooing innocence on debut single If You Had My Love and supernatural levels of sultriness on I'm Into You.
J.Lo's has had her fair share of missteps, but the success of 2011's On the Floor (her first US top 10 in nine years) proves she's not given up just yet. A cipher for good songs rather than the reasons those songs are good she may be, but there are few that do it better.",In Love,Medium

It was to be a marvellous set-piece finale for the group that had defined the decade.
Although large sections of the material had been left over from as far back as their Indian sojourn in the spring of 1968, the overall sound and feel was that of a coherent and logical work, which played to every one of the foursome's considerable strengths.
John Lennon would frequently dismiss the album after its release, but Abbey Road contains three of his very finest works: Come Together, I Want You (She's So Heavy), and Because. George Harrison established himself as an individual talent of some note with the beautiful Something and the ever-lovely Here Comes the Sun, and even Ringo Starr continued to set fair his light entertainer course with Octopus's Garden.
However – the deplorable Maxwell's Silver Hammer aside – Abbey Road is primarily a triumph for Paul McCartney, preserving The Beatles' legacy on their less-than-fond farewell. Apart from being fairly low-key on the album's first side, his piecing together of their 'long medley' from leftovers and doodles on the reverse is possibly his greatest sustained achievement, culminating in every member of the group soloing on The End. Although this side is responsible for myriad crimes later committed in its name (think the worst of 10cc, ELO, Alan Parsons Project), it is a mature and intelligent coda to the single most important act British music produced.
The Beatles’ work was done. They'd come to symbolise the 60s, taken youth culture to the world, and ultimately collapsed under the responsibility, the weight they had to carry. Abbey Road is the soundtrack to it all.",Happy,Medium

The accompanying pieces on the EP are anomalies in the Beatles oeuvre but they aren't statements per se, or indications that the group is in any sort of transition. But if there was ever a moment in the Beatles' lifetime that listeners would have been happy to have the group just settle in and release songs as soon as possible, it was just before and after the then-interminable 10-month gap between the Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's. Without that context, the results could seem slight-- a sort-of canonized version of Past Masters perhaps-- but whether it's an album, a collection of separate pieces, or whatnot matters little when the music itself is so incredible.",Happy,

For a man who’s now been dead just over a year, Michael Jackson has been awfully productive lately. This is his sixth posthumous release since he collapsed and died on June 25 last year, his body coursing with Propofol and Lorazepam, midway through rehearsals for the This Is It tour. Yet Michael is notable for being the first release thus far with any legitimate claim to containing new, original material. Biographer Ian Halperin claimed that in the March before he died Jackson had recorded over 100 songs he didn’t want released until after he died. The first set of new songs, then; but almost certainly not the last.

Not that it’s a given proud perfectionist Jackson would have wanted many of these songs to have seen the light of day even when he had expired. New, it should be noted, is a word open for manipulation when it comes to deceased multibillion-selling artists. Syrupy closer Too Much Too Soon hails from the Thriller era; Hollywood Tonight, meanwhile, is a scrap of a song dusted off and tarted up from 2001’s Invincible sessions. If there is a heaven, and if Tupac, Cobain, Presley et al made it through the gates, chances are they’re consoling a wincing, visibly embarrassed Jackson, cursing his inability to bolt the demos drawer in Neverland’s vaults just that little bit tighter.

Michael is also a release notable for its special guests. 50 Cent turns up on Monster, a song which is essentially Thriller stripped of everything that’s brilliant about the tune, while Jackson and Akon battle it out to be the dominant force on opener Hold My Hand. Somewhere beneath the Senegalese-American’s ""woos"" and ""yeahs"" there’s a passable Michael Jackson B side, but anything that’s good about it spends the entirety of the songs running time battling to break through. Marginally better is the Lenny Kravitz collaboration (I Can’t Make It) Another Day, thanks largely to just how energised Jackson sounds. Though the guitarist does his best to sully matters by noodling all over the top of it.

Last month Jackson’s mother Katherine claimed that many of the songs on Michael contain vocals that belong to voices that aren’t her son’s. Record label Sony refute the claims, assembling a team of former associates – studio engineers and the like – to give creditability to their defence. But for anyone who feels passionately about the legacy of Michael Jackson, his mother’s caution is certainly worth consideration based on the content here, regardless of the facts.",Quirky,Medium

2118213,Got to Be There,Michael Jackson,1972,Rock/Pop,Pop,Epic,Album,3200000,,6.5,4,"Jackson's debut solo album was released in the hope to capitalize on America's love for the pint-sized cute singer from The Jackson Five. In 1972 Jackson was 14 and ready to branch out on his own, however his deal with Motown meant he was not able to release any of his own material so the album is a slick blend of pop covers and R&B songs given the already supremely professional and ridiculously powerful performance by Michael. The album did not sell as well as expected, although the singles kept Jackson's name high in the charts for many months. It was generally well received as an add on to The Jackson 5 material and showed that Jackson was able to complete a solo record without much backing successfully.

'Got To Be There' is a fairly strong, unfairly underrated debut. Most people usually see Off The Wall as Jacko's debut and forget his non-Jackson 5 albums from before the 80s. Many of these songs could easily feature on a Jackson 5 album but without the help of his brothers Michael shows here that he was capable of performing on his own. It would take a few albums before he, and the world, realized that he could only go so far with his family and with other people's songs. This is a short, lightweight album on the surface with a few decent singles, but looking closer we can see that the vocals and performance are what carry the whole. Even at this young age Michael sounded light-years ahead of contemporaries when it came to his voice. There has never been a voice like the Michael of Bad and Thriller, but equally there will never be another voice quite as powerful as a young Michael Jackson.",Quirky,Medium
2118216,Invincible,Michael Jackson,2001,Rock/Pop,Pop,Epic,Album,13000000,,7,3,"This is Michael Jackson as we've come to expect him.

It's been six years since he last released a new album and a lot has happened since. The Spice Girls have been and gone, Destiny's Child have become the hottest R&B act around, UK Garage and Nu-Metal have both arrived. His 80s colleague Madonna has gone from dwindling sales in the mid-90s to become more credible, successful and respected than ever. So where does that leave Jackson? His answer is the sixteen track - and 77 minute - Invincible. Those expecting a 'Ray of Light' kind of re-invention - forget it. This is Michael Jackson as we've come to expect him.

The album is a mixture of upbeat tracks with his usual yelps - when he does actually sing his voice is still amazing. The best of these are '2000 Watts', 'Whatever Happens' and 'Threatened'. The ballads which make up most of this album cover his usual concerns - his privacy, children and falling in love. Some of them are good, but the others are pure Disney like 'The Lost Children' or 'Speechless'. If you are a big Michael Jackson fan and like what he does there is plenty here to keep you happy. However, if you are just curious to see whether the hype, the wait or the money has been worth the wait - you might just find that there isn't enough here which is fresh or original. It's not a great album and it's not a bad album. It's just not very thrilling.",Quirky,Medium

Although Michael had previously released four solo albums as part of the Jackson 5 franchise on Motown, it was this, his first album on Epic that would break him as a worldwide superstar.
In collaborating with producer Quincy Jones, Off The Wall found Jackson using his newly found creative freedom by departing from his previous Motown sound, instead opting for an album that combined disco, soul, pop, soft rock and funk influences. Additional to Jones' polished, professional productions, Michael Jackson collaborated with some of the finest songwriters of the time, including Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. As a result, Off The Wall became the first album ever to spawn four Billboard Top Ten singles: Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Rock With You, Off The Wall and She's Out Of My Life.
Since it's release, Off The Wall has sold over fifteen million copies and many critics believe as an album it has not been bettered by any of Michael Jackson's subsequent output.",Quirky,

2118223,Thriller,Michael Jackson,1982,Rock/Pop,Pop,Epic,Album,65000000,9,9.2,13,"It’s hard to believe now, but when Michael Jackson’s Thriller was released in the UK in time for Christmas 1982, there was an initial sense of misfire. In choosing the album's most lacklustre track, The Girl Is Mine, as its lead single, the postcard delivered was mildly disappointing. The playful duet with Paul McCartney, chosen no doubt to emulate the success McCartney had had earlier the same year with Stevie Wonder on Ebony and Ivory, was simply not what the listeners were expecting. It reached number eight on the UK chart, and the album sold well, but certainly not in the manner that the man who’d delivered Off the Wall should have done.
By the following Christmas, Thriller had become the phenomenon it remains to this day. Singles kept dropping off the album like golden fruit from a platinum bough: the precision snap of that snare on UK number one Billie Jean; the raucous Eddie Van Halen guitar on Beat It; the groove-driven frenzy of Wanna Be Startin' Something. It became apparent that this was a remarkable, ever-yielding pop jukebox.
By 1984, the album got an extension on its lifecycle with the John Landis-directed video for Thriller, which took the album from successful pop record to cultural icon. Casting the then-clean cut, scandal-free singer as a werewolf in a 15-rated short film was a risk, but one that truly paid off. Soon enough Thriller had become a greatest hits package ”“ seven of its nine tracks were issued as singles.
Love it or hate it, Thriller is pop's great, immovable Everest. Marketing departments realised that more and more singles could be pulled from a record to prolong its shelf life, and Michael Jackson became the King of Pop with the whole of the recording industry at his investiture.
It was, of course, never the same for Jackson after Thriller. All that followed was a long, gradual downhill slope that culminated in some forgettable records and a tragic early death. But this view from the summit remains unparalleled.",Quirky,Medium
2118224,Bad,Michael Jackson,1987,Rock/Pop,Pop,Epic,Album,45000000,7,9.7,10,"A multi-million-unit-shifter, Bad was (and remains) as important to 1980s pop culture as the rise of the Walkman, the Back to the Future movies, and the shooting of JR. Like 1982’s Thriller, it’s an album that appeared to easily find a home within the record collection of rockers and poppers, punks and poets alike.
Ubiquity comes cheap in 2012 (thanks, internet), but in 1987, it was earned by being the best of the best. And Bad was just that: almost a greatest hits package, it spawned nine hit singles. Its chart campaign didn’t begin with the title cut, but with I Just Can’t Stop Loving You, a number one in both the US and UK. In Britain, Bad (the song) peaked at 3, as Rick Astley sat atop the pile.
The title track rocketed to No.1 in the US, followed by The Way You Make Me Feel, Man in the Mirror and Dirty Diana. Jackson’s star was at its zenith across the 1980s – but fame never guarantees critical approval. Yet Bad was as well-received in the press as it was by Jackson’s fans. It’s a special rarity: a commercial behemoth with nary a lapse in quality across its 48 minutes.
Quincy Jones’ production is tight yet yielding, every song allowed to breathe and never cluttered by needless elements. Dirty Diana is remarkably lean, Steve Stevens’ flamboyant guitar aside, yet powerful too. Speed Demon, deemed “filler” by critics at the time, is fun funk-rock that’d sit happily on a Prince album of the period, compositionally if not lyrically.
Unreleased demos make up the majority of this anniversary release’s second disc. Amongst the most interesting are Song Groove (A/K/A Abortion Papers) and Price of Fame. The former, aggressive of percussion yet light of synth, is about a Christian girl carrying an unwanted pregnancy. “Michael knew (it) could be controversial,” read the accompanying notes; but Jackson handles the subject matter with tenderness.
Price of Fame addresses the pressures Jackson felt as a pop idol. Of his obsessed followers, he wrote: “They’ll do anything and it’s breaking my heart… It’s running me crazy.” It is, perhaps, a first instance of the cracks that’d soon spread. But nothing that was to come in Jackson’s career could ever take the shine off this awesome, evergreen and essential pop masterpiece.",Quirky,Medium

2110671,Rated R,Rihanna,2009,Rock/Pop,Pop,Roc Nation,Album,3000000,,7.6,5,"In every sense, Rihanna is an extraordinary pop star. Still only 21, she has sold 12 million records worldwide, and bagged the longest-running British number one single of the decade with Umbrella – a song with a perfect title for 2007’s rainy summer, which, nevertheless, had an oddly stark and far-reaching sound for its time.
Two years on, her new LP nods towards adult material in its title as she comes of age, and also follows her assault earlier this year by ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, the results of which were shown in a horrific leaked photograph, the ghosts of which Rihanna works through here. She sounds bolder and braver as a consequence, pushing her strangeness as a pop star to the next level.
Mad House sets the album’s mood well, beginning like a dubstep track before a male voice cuts through the gloom: “Ladies and gentlemen – to those among you who are easily frightened we suggest you turn away now. To those of you who think they can take it, we say welcome.” Imagine Michael Jackson’s Thriller made terrifyingly modern, with Rihanna’s subsequent invitations – “come on, come on in” – both baiting and seducing her listeners.
As the album jabs and stutters onwards, her Barbadian vowels still conjure up the bluntness of reggae delivery, and continue to give her sound directness and edge. The sounds that surround it are more of a mixed bag, however – fantastic when they are icily futuristic on the dark electronica of G4L and Hard, less so on the Latin-flavoured trance of Te Amo, or Slash’s rock guitar theatrics on Rockstar 101.
Rated R’s lyrics are its calling cards, however, glowering darkly in songs like Fire Bomb, Russian Roulette and Cold Case Love. Many hint towards her relationship with Brown – “what you did to me was a crime”; “I cant wait to see your face when the front windows break”, ”all I’ve got are these photographs” –  but they take them to the heights of grand, sci-fi cinema, with Rihanna turning into a revenge-hunting, firebrand diva. The stronger she sounds, the more it suits her, too.
Rihanna has achieved so much already, and this album suggests she will continue to do so in widescreen, and on her own terms.",In Love,
2110672,Talk That Talk,Rihanna,2011,Rock/Pop,Pop,Roc Nation,Album,2000000,,6.8,4,"An artist experiencing diminishing returns since 2009’s startling reinvention album Rated R – from victim to victorious in one long-player – Rihanna’s latest can’t stop the rot that set in with the mixed messages of 2010’s Loud. Not that said set was poor – it just failed to match the pop highs of the Umbrella-packing Good Girl Gone Bad and Rated R’s darker tones. The tracks of sixth LP Talk That Talk make a lot of noise but move lethargically – familiar tropes surface in the lyrical content (sexy times being the core focus), and musically it’s a smorgasbord of European dance trends and contemporary RnB production, showy but soulless. Of course there are ballads, too – but after all the saucy front, the slowies feel utterly blunted.
The album begins at a low, the staccato vocal hooks of You Da One irritating rather than engaging. The squelchy, buzzing Where Have You Been is one of two productions from Calvin Harris – indicative of the mainstream dance scene of the UK and Europe making steady progression into the US RnB market. It’s an inoffensive pairing of building beats and sliced-and-diced vocals: to the right feet on the right dancefloor it’ll be manna itself manifested as an arms-in-the-air clubbing highlight. The second Harris hook-up, We Found Love, swells with fevered keys until it explodes, blinding neon like, all over its frenetic, repetitive chorus. It’s by-numbers fare from Harris, given edge by a quite deliberately provocative music video – just the 47 million YouTube views since mid-October.
A forgettable vocal from Jay-Z on the title-track foreshadows an awful exercise in quasi-erotic wordplay on Cockiness (Love It) and a wholly pointless minute-something in the company of star producer The-Dream, wasted on the boring profanities of Birthday Cake. At its halfway mark Talk That Talk takes a turn for the downbeat, the Beyoncé-style paean to perfect monogamy We All Want Love sitting awkwardly beside questionable sexual morals presented by earlier cuts. And Drunk on Love, for the second time in as many weeks release-wise after Rihanna’s guest slot on Drake’s Take Care, matches the Barbadian singer with a Jamie xx (Smith) production, the backing a slightly tweaked take on The xx’s Intro. It feels lazy, an impression that runs the course of this collection, which never convinces the listener that the artist on its cover is fully committed to the cause. On the commercial dubstep rumble of bonus track Red Lipstick, produced by Chase & Status, she sounds as if she phoned in her (again, drearily sexual) vocal five minutes after waking up.
In the recent past Rihanna exhibited a cool nonchalance; here, she’s trapped between playing the characters of a ruthless dominatrix and a docile sort willing to be putty in a boy’s hands. If the real Rihanna doesn’t stand up for her seventh LP, one has to wonder if she’ll ever find herself again.",In Love,
2110674,Loud,Rihanna,2010,Rock/Pop,Pop,Roc Nation,Album,0,,7.5,4,"Rihanna’s fifth album in as many years has been described by the singer as ""sassy, fun, flirty, energetic"" – a return to the slick pop with which she made her name following last year’s darker Rated R. But it’s not quite that simple; after all, that album delivered the dancehall smash Rude Boy while this record closes with Love the Way You Lie (Part II), an affecting sequel to her Eminem collaboration that takes on added relevance given the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of ex-boyfriend Chris Brown.
Loud certainly (if intermittently) lives up to the singer’s promise. It is brilliantly sassy and exuberant at times – the enormous synth and shout-along chorus of Only Girl (In the World) is about the measure of it, while Nicki Minaj makes for a superb partner in crime on Raining Men, her wild, kinetic flow complementing Rihanna’s steely delivery to wicked effect.
Disappointingly though, the knowing strangeness that coloured even Rated R’s most chart-friendly moments has been toned down in favour of a brazen sexuality that sits at odds with what Rihanna is trying to accomplish here. Since when was ‘flirtatious’ synonymous with ‘sadomasochistic’? As bracingly huge and catchy as it is, S&M doesn’t deviate much from its blunt title: lyrics like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones / But chains and whips excite me"" feel forced, not daring. Similarly, her insistence that ""I like it rough"" on the comparatively restrained Skin can’t help but come across a little uncomfortable in the light of her personal history.
But the argument over whether songs like this subjugate or empower their female performers is one for another time, or maybe one not worth having at all – not when the songs are this good, the singer’s voice this powerful. What’s My Name? features the similarly young and talented Drake mulling the ""square route of 69"" over choppy Caribbean rhythms that reappear on Man Down, where Rihanna relays a break-up as murder metaphor in thick Barbadian patois. Love the Way You Lie (Part II) even bests the original, Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting.",In Love,

2126729,Unapologetic,Rihanna,2012,Rock/Pop,Pop,Roc Nation,Album,3000000,,6.8,5,"Unapologetic is Rihanna’s seventh album in as many years, and makes for a demanding listen. The ""drunk workhorse"" character of the Barbadian singer, who frequented previous albums in some capacity, is absent here.
Instead of anything cheeky or fun, this set is laced with the very real presence of someone using the spectacle of pop music to inadvertently condone abuse.
The Chris Brown duet, Nobody's Business, is inevitably the central attraction of this album. It’s a wonderfully light throwback to late-80s piano house; but its lyrics make the listener feel like an intruder. “You'll always be the one that I wanna come home to,” Rihanna sings, marching on down the aisle, caught up in Brown’s cooing response.
It’s not new for people to write songs about abusive relationships – recorded by the likes of Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington, the 1922 blues standard Ain’t Nobody’s Business explicitly addresses violence against women. But it is perhaps new for songwriters to be commissioned specifically for the task.
Bold production disguises some of the bad taste – but lines like “Like a bullet your love hit me to the core / I was flying ‘til you knocked me to the floor”, from No Love Allowed, are uncomfortably balanced between true love and awkward acrimony. And the mixture of emotions across Unapologetic just doesn’t sit right.
On What Now, Rihanna takes a look in the mirror and tells us that she doesn’t know how to cry. On Jump, she preaches that she won’t be chasing her ex; perhaps the Ginuwine sample and multipack of Chase & Status bass drops inhibit her conviction.
Throughout, the context and rancour can’t be shaken – but at least there’s clarity between Rihanna’s defiance on the club tracks and the heavy sadness in the ballads.
Maybe Unapologetic is proof that we should have more faith in young audiences’ reasoned understanding. Maybe it’s a hammering of the point that pop music shouldn’t shy away from real life’s sadness. But more realistically, Unapologetic seems to position Rihanna as a human being dragged headfirst into a breakdown, and somehow surviving it.",In Love,Medium

2112976,19,Adele,2008,Rock/Pop,Soul,XL Recordings,Album,6500000,2,8.5,6,"It's easy to get the wrong impression about Adele. She looks like another Kate Nash, all Top Shop dresses and haircuts that only a mother could love. And the fact that she's been a fuss on MySpace for a while only ups the sense of trepidation. Add to that a Later… debut which came filled to the brim with nervous caterwauling, and hopes for her album aren't pitched particularly high.
This is why it's such a shock that it's a genuinely touching, maturely considered and brilliantly sung opus that belies her titular age. Listening to it for the first time is the aural equivalent of walking into one of those oh-so-quirky little bars that you expect to be filled with bland scenesters and discovering that everyone within is friendly and they're serving the finest soul food to fill you up with.
Pitching up somewhere between blues, folk and jazz, she's included something for everyone without ever pandering to a particular trend. Her melodies exude warmth, her singing is occasionally stunning and, in the dramatic Hometown Glory, the spiky cool of Cold Shoulder (which is unexpectedly reminiscent of Shara Nelson-era Massive Attack) and the piano epic Make You Feel My Love, she has tracks that make Lily Allen and Kate Nash sound every bit as ordinary as they are.
That said, there is a note of caution to be sounded. There's a danger of the hyperbole exceeding the actual potential here: The Brit Awards made her their first ever winner of the Critics' Choice award and the BBC's Sound of 2008 list named her as the most promising new music talent in UK, while one magazine compared her songbook with Leonard Cohen's! While she is undoubtedly good, she's not quite worthy of those accolades yet, as her voice lacks a little soul and her songwriting a little depth.
Adele is a fine prospect and a genuine talent, but just like Amy Winehouse, who went to the same performing arts school, her brilliance will truly shine when she's a little further into her career – though hopefully, she'll be better at handling the astronomical fame that awaits her than the crumbling Mrs Fielder-Civil.
19 is a great start, a solid base to build a career on and a wonderful reminder of just how great our home grown talent can be. Just goes to show that the old adage is true – you really can't go judging a pop star by their cover.",In Love,Slow
2112977,21,Adele,2011,Rock/Pop,Soul,XL Recordings,Album,26000000,4,9,8,"One of the few real beneficiaries of The X Factor effect – her version of Dylan’s Make You Feel My Love has been darting about the top 40 since the audition rounds, showing more staying power than poor Joe McElderry’s last two singles combined – Adele’s stock has risen significantly since becoming the first recipient of the Brits Critics’ Choice award. Since then she’s picked up Grammys and broken the States as a bonus, so the pressure was clearly on for her next move to deliver big. And, oh my, with 21 doesn’t she just.
The last few years have seen those who started strongly become mightily unstuck on their sophomore efforts. For every Lily Allen there’s been a Kate Nash or a Duffy – the latter’s comeback, Endlessly, seems to have fallen on significantly fewer ears than the 2.8 million who liked her debut – so it’s a treat to hear that no such problems beset 21. It really is so marvellous, you’re almost compelled to stand up and applaud it after the first listen.
With a top-notch production team behind the album, including Rick Rubin and Paul Epworth, every track is a highlight. Current single, Rolling in the Deep, is a modern soul stomper about an errant ex; the literally banging Rumour Has It channels the avenging rock‘n’roll soul of Wanda Jackson; there’s a fine, mellow, acoustic bossa nova-y take on The Cure’s Lovesong. Don’t You Remember is a classically styled ballad, which feels like the sort of tune you’ve known all your life – many are certain to bawl along to it the next time their hearts are broken; and the blues-bruised I’ll Be Waiting could’ve come from any Willie Mitchell-produced southern soul session. Final track Someone Like You, just voice and piano, is an actual thing of beauty, placing the listener in one of those moments where you feel you’re in the presence of a future standard. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike.
21 is simply stunning. After only a handful of plays, it feels like you’ve always known it. It will see Adele become an even greater award magnet come the end of the year, leaving her contemporaries for dust. Genuinely brilliant.",In Love,Slow

2261888,25,Adele,2015,Rock/Pop,Soul,XL Recordings,Album,25000000,1,8.3,3,"It only seems five minutes ago that Adele Adkins was just another teenage singer/songwriter, following in the footsteps of Lily Allen and Kate Nash, singing songs about London and boys, having a mouth like a sailor and singing backing vocals for Jack Penate (remember him?).

It was, in fact, 8 years ago that we first heard those plaintive piano chords of Hometown Glory, and in that time Adele has become arguably the biggest British pop star we currently have: holding so much sway in fact that she can quite easily demand her album not be available on any streaming platforms, thus forcing people who want to hear it to actually - shock, horror - buy it. Even Taylor Swift eventually succumbed to the might of Apple Music.

So, Adele's third album is easily the most anticipated record of the year, and is already on track to sell over 2.5 million copies in its first week alone - an astonishing achievement for an artist who barely plays live, never tours and has been pretty much silent for the past four years. Adele has, after all, never been one to play by the normal music industry rules (she pretty much broke America via a YouTube video of her singing at the BRIT Awards), but there's a nagging feeling that 25 can't possibly live up to all the hype.

And, in a sense, it doesn't. It certainly won't disappoint the legions of fans desperate for new material, but 25 is very much Adele playing safe. By now, you know what you're going to get from an Adele album: lots of sad songs about former lovers, custom-made to make people cry on their pillow. Yet, there's so much more to her than that, especially given that extraordinary voice: remember the sass of Rumour Has It, or the barely concealed anger bubbling under the surface of Rolling In The Deep? That side of Adele is nowhere to be found on her third record.

Having said that, it's impossible not to fall under its many charms. Hello is the quintessential Adele comeback track - a mix of the sad minor piano chords from Someone Like You on the verse, before soaring magnificently into the Skyfall-like chorus. Yes, the lyrics seem like a retread of previous material: when you hear lines like 'I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet' you do want to reach through the speakers, grab her and shout 'NO, ADELE, EXES ARE EXES FOR A REASON'. That becomes somewhat of a recurring feeling throughout this album. Yet the melody, especially on the verses, is so heart-stoppingly beautiful that you're soon singing along.

When We Were Young, co-written with Tobias Jesso Jr, pulls on similar heartstrings - a hushed ballad which may not take too many risks, but is worth the price of admission for the moment when Adele's voice cracks with emotion as she sings the line 'my God this reminds me of when we were young'. If you can ignore the rather disconcerting feeling of a woman still a good few years away from 30 reminiscing about her apparently long-gone youth, it's the sort of performance that will give you chills. This will be the song you'll find difficult to escape from during Christmas and beyond, whether you want to or not.

25 becomes at its most interesting though when Adele steps out of her comfort zone. Send My Love (To Your New Lover) is one of those occasions, a collaboration with uber-pop svengali Max Martin, a sassy, flamenco-tinged banger that's one of the few moments of 25 that could be called danceable. Another highlight is River Lea (there's a big water motif running through 25), which sounds absolutely enormous, a giant gospel-influenced stomp of a song which looks back to the comforting nostalgia of childhood with the bittersweet knowledge that you can never truly go home again.

Yet there's a few too many times on 25 when Adele seems to be treading water. Tracks like Love In The Dark or Remedy may be beautifully performed but it's very much what we've heard before. A Million Years Ago showcases another flawless vocal performance, but you'd be hard-pressed to remember much about it even after several listens, while All I Ask sounds oddly dated, despite the presence as co-writer of the ubiquitous Bruno Mars.

None of which will matter a jot to the millions of people who'll buy and constantly play 25, of course - people expect Adele albums to do a certain job now, and 25 ticks all the relevant boxes. However, next time round it'll be good to hear her break out of that comfort zone: while she's earned the right to stick to that tried and trusted formula, a little bit of experimentation could go a long way.",In Love,Medium

It's a piercing shot at any young pretenders, past, present and future, who think they've what it takes to take on the Queen of Pop in her fiftieth year, and one that reverberates across her eleventh album.
Laying herself at the mercy of producers savvy enough to churn out hits in their sleep, Madonna has put her reputation on the line for Hard Candy, but it's a calculated risk, and although she could have done it better, it's still a mighty record.
In essence, the album is not the hip hop tribute many had feared, but an urban extension of 2005's Confessions On A Dancefloor. The disco still rules supreme (just listen to the funk-overload of Dance 2Nite) and the dancefloor remains Madonna's sexual playground. Yet, with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Nate 'Danja' Hills and Pharrell Williams at the helm, the RnB edge is added. Williams' breathy punctuation and tinny percussion spill over from the album's opener Candy Shop and Timbaland's distorted bass beats make for wonderfully messy melodies, particularly on the superb climax, 12 Voices ”“ Madonna's most haunting sound since Frozen.
The argument that this tried and tested production work could be a template for any artist (Madonna only has co-writing credits) is a tad churlish. She adds that inimitable zing of excitement that the likes of Nelly Furtado don't possess and the record is not without its personal moments. Take the genuinely good, genuinely felt Miles Away; an electro missive concerning her relationship with husband Guy Ritichie (''I guess we're at our best when we're miles away''). Besides, many milestones of Madonna's epic career ”“ Holiday, Get Into The Groove, Ray Of Light and Music - are marked throughout.
Undeniably, it's the work with Timbaland and co. that really sells Hard Candy. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal hook on 4 Minutes is worth the download fee alone and the album's penultimate track, Devil Wouldn't Recognise You, is the next best thing after Timberlake's What Goes Around”¦
Meanwhile, Williams isn't as dependable. Tracks like the awkward Spanish Lesson and the badly paced Incredible, where the frenetic finish isn't worth the four minute wait, represent more fool's gold than the real deal. In contrast, Give It 2 Me, where children's TV meets trance and techno, is a wholesome sugar rush.
Easy to chew, Hard Candy is everything you'd hope for from a Madonna album; excitement, adventure and progress. Something tells me it just might sell”¦ ",Happy,

2117323,The Confessions Tour,Madonna,2007,Rock/Pop,Pop,,Live,0,,,,"There were two things that stood out about Madonna’s 51-date 2006 Confessions tour. First, by raking in a tidy $260.1 million, it easily became the highest-grossing tour by a female artist”¦ ever, and second, by attaching herself to a giant mirrored cross, she secured, at a guess, about 260 million column inches of criticism from religious leaders in every country she set foot. So with headline-makers focussing energy on money and religion, little was written about the music. Thankfully the good folks at Warner have churned out a live album of the singer’s London date to help fill the gap.

In keeping with the non-stop roller disco feel of Madonna’s Confessions On A Dancefloor album, the live version is a big fat neon light of a pop-dance explosion. There’s a party going on, and unless you were there in the first place, you’re not invited. Whistles and whoops rarely cease and applause ripples throughout building into regular raptures for a consistently first-class performer. It’s almost enough to make those who weren’t there jealous. Almost.

Unlike 1.2 million others across the world, I didn’t make it to see Madonna and her cross-hanging exploits. As a result, some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. The CD starts with a four minute applauseathon on ‘’Future Lovers/I Feel Love’’ and finishes with an excruciating three minute audience/star duet on No. 1 hit ‘’Hung Up’’ - Surely this could have been trimmed into a friendlier edit? Other lowlights include a ‘’Sorry (Remix)’’ straight after the original and the dawdling ‘’Confessions’’ which you’d hope was easier on the eye than on the ear.

Elsewhere, things are much brighter. ‘’Like A Virgin’’, ‘’Erotica’’ and ‘’Music Inferno’’ (Music mixed with ‘’Disco Inferno’’”¦ geddit?) have been put through the disco processor with spectacular results and the unmeddled ‘’Sorry’’ is a delight. A minute proportion of the tour-earnings have been spent on the sound quality to good effect, even if it does mean you pick up every inhalation of breath.

As far as live albums go, this is a job well done. We’ll save debating the existence of live albums for another time. ",Happy,

2117425,MDNA,Madonna,2012,Rock/Pop,Pop,,Album,0,,7,3,"Madonna is judged to a higher standard than the common or garden songbird. When you've sold 300 million records, racked up enough hits to omit Deeper and Deeper from your two-CD greatest hits set, and generally become the sort of pop culture colossus who can publish a book featuring a photo of yourself hang-gliding naked, well, people just expect more.
Which is why the opening song on her 12th studio album is so disheartening. It's a fairly charmless genero-banger called Girls Gone Wild on which this 53-year-old mother-of-four trills: ""You got me in the zone / DJ play my favourite song.""
MDNA picks up as soon as it finishes, but it's never the most innovative or sonically adventurous Madonna LP. Featuring production from French DJ Martin Solveig, house maestro Benny Benassi and Madge veteran William Orbit, it sounds contemporary(ish) rather than cutting edge. Nor is it a cohesive artistic statement like 1998's Ray of Light. At times, Madonna seems to be using her lyrics to teach her kids the meaning of the word clichÃ©. If she's not ""a fish out of water"", she's ""a bat out of hell"" or ""a moth to a flame""”¦ Got it now, Rocco?
However, there's no denying MDNA delivers thrills. In true Ciccone fashion, club pop pounders like Some Girls, Love Spent and Turn Up the Radio seem to push a bit harder than the competition ”“ that last one's got a drop like an open manhole. MDNA also has something the last two Madge albums lacked: ballads, both of which are quite lovely.
Best of all, several moments prompt a welcome sigh: ""God, only Madonna"". Gang Bang is a preposterous piece of pop schlock featuring gangster film sound effects and the old girl gunning ”“ quite literally ”“ for revenge. I Don't Give A has Madge rapping and ribbing herself in the process: ""Ride my horse, break some bones / Take it down a semitone."" I'm Addicted climaxes with a pulse-quickening ""M-D-N-A"" chant; when they're old enough, it'll define ‘iconoclastic’ to her brood.

A support slot on Mott The Hoople’s American tour and a minor hit (with “Seven Seas Of Rhye”) had left critics and fans eagerly awaiting their next move. But, following a gruelling touring agenda, disaster was to strike. Guitarist Brian May (he of the clogs and PhD in astrophysics) fell ill with hepatitis and the band were forced to begin work on their new album as a threesome.
Fate was on the band’s side. The tracks laid down in May’s absence had a sparseness that he could finally embellish to his full satisfaction (ie: LOADS). Also, ironically, the band was forced to dig into their back catalogue to come up with material. Both Mercury and May put forward future classics that had been numbers with their old bands: May’s “Brighton Rock” (formerly a Smile song called “Blag”) and Mercury’s “Stone Cold Crazy” (from his old band Wreckage). The latter presaged speed metal by years, eventually being covered by Metallica.
By this time the band had honed their Zeppelin-meets-Hendrix-in-Biba sound to perfection. Mercury’s “Lily Of The Valley” retains the same campness that blighted their previous work but “Killer Queen” was three minutes of romping pop perfection. May was now the master of the delay pedal (“Brighton Rock” was a future live guitar marathon showcase) Most importantly this was a band with new experiences and maturity to draw on. May’s “Now I’m Here” details their touring experiences with Mott while Mercury turned in one of his patent character assassinations with “Flick Of The Wrist”. It was also a truly group effort. Both Taylor and Deacon debuted songs on SHA. Taylor’s “Tenement Funster” is pure cod-rock nonsense but his stratospheric vocals and Bonham-esque drumming were now an integral part of the Queen sound. Deacon showed how his grasp of pop dynamics on the brief “Misfire” would lead to him writing some of the band’s most enduring hits.
In anticipation of their next album, they stretched contemporary production methods to their very limit with multi-layered vocals and guitars and Freddie’s vaudevillian streak finally emerged (“Bring Back That Leroy Brown”). This was the album that finally saw Queen find their true voice(s).

2109610,News of the World,Queen,1977,Rock/Pop,Rock,,Album,0,,9,2,"Queen's varied palette of styles was none more apparent than on their sixth studio album, News Of The World, recorded over summer 1977 at various locations in London. Released as punk was breaking across the UK music scene (prompting the delicious exchange when Freddie Mercury met Sid Vicious: ""ah, Mr. Ferocious, how are you?""), the album showed the group, for many the ultimate in musicianship, both out-of-kilter, yet strangely in step with the times.
In step was the football-terrace proto-rap “We Will Rock You”, the anthemic Mercury special “We Are The Champions” and the full-on assault of the Roger Taylor/Mercury duet “Sheer Heart Attack”. Out of kilter with the times was the ornate, fussy balladry of John Deacon’s “Spread Your Wings” or Mercury’s bluesy “My Melancholy Blues”. Elsewhere, the heavily strutting “Get Down Make Love” acts as something of a bridge between the earlier “Seven Seas Of Rhye” and the “Another Ones Bites The Dust” funk-isms that lay ahead.
News Of The World was the last of the classic-period Queen albums, and heralded a spell in the relative doldrums before 1980's The Game. The album was a huge hit in America, something the group could never take for granted; and went four times platinum, largely as a result of their lengthy tour with Thin Lizzy earlier in the year. What News Of The World demonstrates perfectly is Queen’s unerringly ability to sound absolutely like no-other group ”“ even when parodying other musical styles",Rousing,

2113808,Greatest Hits I & II,Queen,1994,Rock/Pop,Rock,,Compilation,0,,8,1,"Serious question: is anyone left in the known cosmos who hasn’t already heard these songs? Is it possible to think of Darth Vader after a hard day at the office blowing up planets without imagining him retiring to his chamber afterwards to put his feet up with a nice glass of chardonnay and Somebody to Love on the stereo? Can one really picture Spock and Kirk in the holodeck, playing a game of squash without their preferred soundtrack, You’re My Best Friend?
Apparently there are people still on this very planet, Earth, who have never been exposed to the rock and roll majesty of Queen and their iconic Greatest Hits albums. And while there are tapir-hunting tribesmen in Borneo who haven’t heard the ‘politically of its day’ harmonised rock of Fat Bottomed Girls, and goat-milking crofters on the Isle of Arran who are unaware of the priapic, steroid-pumped funk rock of Another One Bites the Dust, it is EMI’s right ”“ nay, their duty ”“ to keep on reissuing these essential rock artefacts.
Only a fool would try and find fault with these discs. While they don’t necessarily contain all of Queen’s finest tracks (Sheer Heart Attack from News of the World, for example) or even all their best singles (It’s Late, for another example), they certainly are the mightiest statements the four-piece ever recorded. These are essential compilations that any coach driver, jukebox filler or wedding DJ worth their salt will have as the bedrock of their collection.
The first volume (pictured, tracklisting to the left) is one of the most successful albums of all time, having shifted 25 million copies and covers the first stage of their career, spanning Seven Seas of Rye (1974) to Flash (1980). In amongst the songs that even your grandma knows (Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, Don’t Stop Me Now) are a few gems that show exactly how weird Queen were for a mainstream rock group, such as the futuristic howling pomp-rock of Now I’m Here.
While, perhaps unavoidably, the second disc isn’t quite as stunningly impressive, it still charts the second half of their career well (from doldrums to Live Aid to impressive second act to Freddie Mercury’s sad decline) and sold a not unenviable 16 million copies. And even though the melancholia present in their later singles (The Show Must Go On, Innuendo) isn’t something a fan always wants to dwell on, this is also where to find some of their finest moments (Hammer To Fall, I Want To Break Free, Under Pressure).

2116679,A Night at the Opera,Queen,1975,Rock/Pop,Rock,,Album,4100000,1,9.7,6,"Although Queen’s, previous album, Sheer Heart Attack, had yielded two hits, reached number one in the UK and even gone gold in the US it’s a testament that EMI were prepared to let them then create what was, at the time, the most expensive album ever made. A Night At The Opera, borrowing its title from the Marx Brothers’ film could so easily have been an enormous folly.
The aforementioned Sheer Heart Attack had seen their patent methodology of multi-layered recording producing a lush and yes, operatic, ambience produce something that had never been heard before. Combining these swathes of Freddie Mercury and the band’s vocals (both Brian May and Roger Taylor were also perfectly adequate singers) with a thousand guitar lines and Taylor’s Zeppelinesque drums had crossed the pop/rock divide with ease. But this was a band with ambition in spades. ”¦Heart Attack had hinted at a working knowledge of 19th century parlour balladry, 20s ragtime and Jimi Hendrix. A Night At The Opera was to add opera, trad jazz, heavy metal and more to the mix.
Opening with a thinly veiled attack on their previous manager, “Death On Two Legs” the album then careens through a gamut of styles. With the writing divided fairly equally between Mercury and May (with John Deacon and Roger Taylor getting one number apiece as well) it veers between high camp and west coast rock with aplomb. May’s “The Prophet’s Song” serves up a slice of high concept sci fi, while his “39” is amiable country hoke. Mercury, of course, is far more in-yer-face with the frippery of “Seaside Rendezvous” and “Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon”.
Deacon, always the underrated member, may have had only one number, but it was a doozy. “You’re My Best Friend” was the second hit from the album and remains a pop classic; frothy but enduring. Naturally, no coversation about the album is complete without mentioning Mercury’s crowning moment. The multi-part epic, “Bohemian Rhapsody” took months to construct. Beginning as piano ballad, morphing into cod-Mozart and then stomping monster rocker and back to ballad, goodness knows how the band must have felt when he first unveiled it at the keyboard. Hats must also ome off for the executive at EMI who had the faith to release it as a single, following Kenny Everett’s championing of it on Capital Radio. As history records, it went to number one”¦for ever. Christmas 1975 was to be forever remembered as Queen’s. And A Night At The Opera remains their finest hour.",Rousing,Fast

Undeniably, they stole the show. It was inevitable, really; after all, by that stage the band were eating crowds of that size for breakfast and still finding room for an encore. Three years earlier, they had filled the Milton Keynes Bowl with 65,000 of their own adoring fans as part of the Hot Space tour.
Luckily, the camera crews were there to record the event for posterity. Partially broadcast by the BBC in 1982, a bootleg has been circulating ever since. For the Queen completist, therefore, Queen On Fire will make a great stocking filler this Christmas; digitally remastered on DVD and double CD, it features the 25-song set in full.
With hindsight, Hot Space isn't one of Queen's best records; in truth, it's an ill-advised funk/disco album that they and their fans would probably rather forget. Thankfully, it only provides four of the songs on offer here. Otherwise, Queen On Fire is practically Greatest Hits I in concert, give or take a few tracks. All the live favourites are here: ""Love Of My Life"", equal parts graceful lullaby and football terrace chant, but as charming as ever; ""Now I'm Here"", spliced cleverly with The Game's ""Dragon Attack"", and ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", sounding fatter than ever. And of course, it wouldn't be a Queen gig without a little of Freddie's playful crowd mastery.
As promising as the track titled ""Guitar Solo"" on the second disc here will sound to fans of Brian May and his 'Red Special', those familiar with ""Brighton Rock"" from 1974's Sheer Heart Attack will find it more than a little disappointing. Whereas the latter is a virtuoso masterpiece showcasing May's flair for riff juggling, his somewhat directionless solo escapade on this album pales in comparison.
It's almost a relief, then, when the rest of the band return for ""Under Pressure"" (sans Bowie) and proceed to rip through nine of their biggest hitters, during which Brian makes up for his earlier lack of lustre with a blistering rendition of ""Tie Your Mother Down"".
The set finishes predictably but majestically, with Queen's pomp-rock coup de grace: ""We Will Rock You"", followed by ""We Are The Champions"" and ""God Save The Queen"". If you need a reminder of just how invincible Queen were in concert, look no further.",Rousing,

2113121,Definitely Maybe,Oasis,1994,Britpop,Indie,,Album,8000000,,8.8,4,"In August 1994, just a few months after Kurt Cobain killed himself (and the grunge movement that he'd become the reluctant figurehead of), Oasis’ debut Definitely Maybe was released.
To put this seismic attitude shift into perspective: Kurt’s working title for the final Nirvana album, In Utero, was I Hate Myself And I Want To Die. Definitely Maybe’s most popular song is called Live Forever.
So how did two punters from Burnage, an unremarkable area of Manchester, become so famous? Despite the fact that the second album, (What’s the Story?) Morning Glory, sold more copies and propelled them to tabloid superstardom and 10 Downing Street, the answers are all here.
The album kicks off with Rock ‘n’ Roll Star, which Noel has since said was the end of everything he wanted to say as a songwriter. He’s right in a sense, as it’s easily one of the greatest songs about being up on stage ever written. On arguably Liam’s greatest ever vocal performance he goads all-comers with: ""You’re not down with who I am / Look at you now you’re all in my hands tonight."" And that’s without even considering the attendant guitar riffs that snag your brain like barbed wire on your best jumper. If you’ve got a mate or relative who’s having a bad time of it, play them this, then watch them grow 10 feet tall and walk down the street like they rule the whole world.
Although at this point it’s easy to imagine the faces of every other British band of the time sadly searching the classifieds for a new vocation, there are still 10 more tracks left. How about Supersonic, a sky-scraping anthem about individuality adopted by the masses? Or Cigarettes and Alcohol, a brash T Rex paean to hedonism? Or Bring It On Down, a non-stop, no-messing punk stomp to certain death or glory?
It’s easy to trot out the tired argument that these Mancs don’t have the power of The Stone Roses or The Smiths because the songs don’t have the wistful, melancholic air that one comes to expect from songs emerging from that rainy Lancashire city. Is it true to say ""It’s just Beatles songwriting with Sex Pistols attitude""? Maybe. But have these songs transcended the Conservative-greyed and Britpop-glossed years in which they became public property to become heroic, gigantic pop monuments in their own right?

2113123,Dig Out Your Soul,Oasis,2008,Britpop,Indie,,Album,5000000,,6.8,4,"Legend has it that if Noel Coward was back stage after a production that was less than glowing, he'd merely say, ""Darling, you've done it again!"". Thus, unless you truly believe that Oasis are still the saviours of the dead horse we call 'rock 'n' roll' it's pointless to gripe about Dig Out Your Soul. It's a return to form for them and followers who have had their patience tested, waiting for a return to the big swaggering days of yore, will be well-pleased. Yes chaps, you've done it again.
As you'd expect the album's packed with the Sex-Pistols-play-the White-Album material we love 'em for. The Fab-Four-alike game continues with (Get Off Your) High Horse Lady as Give Peace A Chance; the intro to Dear Prudence making up the coda to The Turning; and apparently love is a ''magical mystery'' in The Shock Of The Lightning.
Liam's songs now give him the opportunity to do the 'sensitive' thing that his brother usually reserves for himself. Both I'm Outta Time and closer, Soldier On may be ostensibly Lennon homages, but they're the equal of anything else here. And top double negative expressing Ain't Got Nothin' throws you a curveball with its leery waltz timing. The newly-expanded band democracy also gives room to Andy Bell's The Nature Of Reality: a monstrous boogie, and Gem Archer's drone/raga-style To Be Where There's Life.
It still seems odd that the Mancunians choose cod-psychedelia as their modus operandi. Considering Noel's truculent inability to say anything nice about anyone else who dares to make a record, you get the feeling that if you took Oasis back to 1967 they'd be having a ruck with Syd Barrett and telling Paul McCartney to get ''fookin' real''. Nevertheless, Dig Out Your Soul comes equipped with all kinds of flowery sonic jiggery pokery: bells and even sitars join the footsteps on beaches, police sirens, bleeping games machines etc. But this cartoonish contradiction means that if the band ever really resemble any 60s heroes it's probably the Troggs. Street kids dressed in paisley...
Dig Out Your Soul has a huge sound. As reported by the siblings, it is ''rockin'''. Zak Starkey's drums pound in fine neanderthal style; the guitars crunch and feed back; the barre chords pummel; and Liam's voice still does that sneer that conveys that whatever we may think, he's not remotely bothered.",Reflective,

2113125,(What's the Story) Morning Glory?,Oasis,1995,Britpop,Indie,,Album,22000000,,7.8,6,"Out of the fist-fights and fall out that constituted at least part of the recording of this album, Oasis came out of it with a set of songs that stand-up as their finest to date. As Beatles tribute acts go they’ve probably done more than most to educate a younger class of music fan about the virtues and talents of the Fab Four.
Whilst accepting that they’re heavily indebted to the late-period Fabsters, Noel Gallagher and company bring a lusty aggression to their music that Lennon would only really find briefly in the early stages of his solo career, and that Paul McCartney is probably still looking for. Their confidence, some might say arrogance, is stamped over every last inch of the record. Each track is possessed with an unshakeable belief that anything is possible, that everything is reach.
The flagrant swagger of the record is an essential part of its appeal; fans knew they’d be alright in this lot’s company, and droves of them wanted to be in the gang. Sales were astronomical with two singles, “Some Might Say” and “Don’t Look Back In Anger” hitting number one, whilst “Wonderwall” and “Roll With It” fell in just behind that. Though there’s nothing flash about the music or the ambit of its lyrical content, its solid construction provides it with a dependable familiarity.
The album went up against Blur’s The Great Escape in the Brit-pop battles – a hyped-up turf war that sprung from Oasis’ genuine enmity for what they saw as the la-de-da pretension. As much about the post-Thatcher North/South divide as a punch-up between affectation and authenticity, at least with Oasis what you saw was what you got – they did exactly what they said they’d do on the tin. Now over ten years old “Roll With It” still sounds fresh, as does the title track, whilst “Wonderwall” has lost none of its status as an eternal, yearning anthem.
There’s a fine line between self-assurance and over-confidence but given the size of the egos and volatile emotions involved in its making, remarkably Morning Glory gets it right every time.",Reflective,Medium

But at least they tried, right? On the other hand, one can and must reserve special criticism for the truly talented who choose commercial gain over artistic endeavour, when everyone from Prince to Johnny Cash and (yes, indeed) The Beatles realised that it was possible to combine both ventures.
When Noel Gallagher went to see his kid brother Liam’s band Oasis, their name recently changed from The Rain, play in 1991, legend is that he told them that he would make them famous if they did exactly what he said. And while they stuck firmly to the terms of this uneasy pact they had the sublime experience of both cake ownership and degustation that lasted for several memorable years and two excellent albums.
This utterly unnecessary but partially satisfying “complete” (says the sticker on the sleeve) singles collection manages to fall at the first hurdle by not including their first (and best) 12” from debut album Definitely Maybe, the shameless cocaine elegy Columbia. But it does include the fizzing glam rock twitch of Cigarettes & Alcohol, the impassioned platonic love song to youth that is Live Forever, and the neo Sex Pistols/Beatles bombast of Supersonic.
Listening to these two discs makes it easy to pinpoint the exact moment it all went wrong, though. The eldest Gallagher talked a good game between second LP (What’s The Story) Morning Glory? and third, Be Here Now. He told of how his band were jamming over NWA loops and how, fresh from hanging out with The Chemical Brothers, he was ready to push the group out of their pop origins and into their imperial psychedelic phase, just as his heroes The Fab Four had done. But when Be Here Now’s lead single D’You Know What I Mean? finally lurched into view, Manchester’s finest had obviously changed from being a benign and delightful retro dictatorship to a lowest-common-denominator pub rock democracy. And from this moment on it was sheer torture.
Compared to the early singles, the turgid Songbird and Lyla represent the appalling sonic equivalent of water finding its own level. Every spark of originality had been washed away by educationally sub-normal consensus, and the group’s fatal flaws were now impossible to ignore. More idiot than savant, the stream-of-consciousness lyrics no longer celebrated drunkenness – they necessitated inebriation just for the thick-tongued, back-of-a-fag-pack rhymes to be tolerated.   
Interestingly, at least a quarter of the tracks here are book-ended by a cough, a nasal Mancunian voice muttering darkly or appreciative applause. This is a constant reminder of what you are getting: a cast-iron guarantee of the authenticity not just of the music but the lifestyle the listener is buying into. For aspirational working-class lads (or working-class lads who aspired to be like Oasis – which is not exactly the same thing) and middle-class people with downwardly mobile daydreams, Oasis were the perfect party band for the first two albums of their 15 long years. And no matter who you are and where you come from, I can’t imagine not having had some kind of shared moment with total strangers to a song like Some Might Say. But I can only sympathise with you if you feel the same way about I’m Outta Time.",Reflective,
